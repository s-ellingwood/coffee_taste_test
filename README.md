### Overview
A group of investors is looking to break into the US coffee market. They'd like to leverage insights from "The Great American Coffee Taste Test", a survey conducted by Cometeer and coffee expert James Hoffmann. The data contains survey responses from the ~4,000 Americans who participated in the blind coffee taste test. Details about participants' opinions on each of the four coffees tasted, as well as participants' preferences surrounding coffee and how they drink it, are included.

### Objectives
Answer the following questions in an explanatory report to provide data-driven strategy for a group of investors to open their first coffee shop:
- Target Audience: What type of customer should we target, and what are their preferences?
- Product Offering: What types of coffee beans and drinks should we offer?
- Pricing Strategy: How can we align prices with customer value perception?

### Repository Files
- GACTT_RESULTS_ANONYMIZED_v2.csv: provided by Maven Analytics; contains data on about 4000 individual responses from the Great American Coffee Taste Test survey
- great_american_taste_test.ipynb: the code used to clean & analyze the data and answer project questions.
- The Great American Coffee Taste Test Report Deck.pdf: a PDF file of the slide deck report created to share findings and conclusions.

### Key Insights
- Target Audience: Cluster analysis of the response data shows two main target audiences - Daily Drinkers (older, more routine, and more price-sensitive coffee drinkers) and Café Connoisseurs (younger coffee drinkers who spend more and know more about coffee). Different programs can be offered to target each group such as discount or bundle deals for Daily Drinkers and membership deals or exclusive offers for Café Connoisseurs.
- Bean & Drink Preferences: Those within the two target audiences have a strong preference toward fruity profiles, light roasts, full caffeine, and medium to strong coffee strength. Pourovers are the most common favorite drink, followed by lattes, regular drip coffees, espressos, and cortados. Most typically prefer their coffee black, but the top add-in was milk/dairy alternatives/coffee creamers - specifically whole milk, oat milk, and half and half.
- Price Expectations: Prices should be capped at the highest price Daily Drinkers are typically willing to pay - $8-$10 - given that they are more price sensitive. Prices should also account for the effort and resources that each drink takes, putting the top five drinks on three separate tiers: regular drip & espressos (lowest), pourover and cortados (middle), and lattes (highest).
